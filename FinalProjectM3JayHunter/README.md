Please run ServerCommController.java in the package server.controller first. This will start the server and load data into the database.
Then run Starter.java in the package client.controller second. This will display a main menu screen and connect a client to the server.
The main menu will ask for a username and password, so for an example please type in '1' for the username, and 'a' for the password.
This will then welcome you to a portal page, on one of the premade accounts, where you can choose to view all courses available, search for a course, enroll in a course, view courses you are enrolled in or logout. To log in to the admin window, type in any username and use the password admin. There you will have the option to view all courses, add a course and logout.

A visual example is included with this dropbox.

Bonus Features:
 *Login Window - A username and password is required to access an account
 *Admin Window - Using the password admin on any username during login will bring up an admin window where courses can be added
 *JUnit testing - Junit testing for 2 of the classes is included
 *When a client connects their ip is printed to the server
 *Lots of error checking
